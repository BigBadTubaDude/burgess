				<h1>Dr. Gary Burgess At a Glance</h1>
				<h2>All children are our children</h2>
				<p>Dr. Gary L. Burgess, Sr. is a native of Inman, South Carolina, the second child of the late
				Edward D. and Willean H. Burgess. Burgess is married to the former Quintella M. Howard of
				Chicago, Illinois. They have three adult children Lee, Alexandra, and Nathan; Darian a great-nephew 
				who was reared in their home, and one god-daughter, Joycelyn Hardy, MD.</p>

				<p>Burgess is a graduate of Wofford College, Converse College, and the University of South
				Carolina at Columbia where he earned his doctorate. Burgess served as Assistant
				Superintendent of Schools and Superintendent of Schools in Anderson County School District
				Four, located in historic Pendleton, South Carolina from 2002 to 2008. In 2005 he successfully
				campaigned for a 26.8-million-dollar bond referendum in order to build a new elementary school
				and renovate the existing schools in Anderson County School District Four. This referendum
				passed at a time of soaring gas prices, Hurricane Katrina, and when citizens across South
				Carolina were rejecting such referendums. He left the district in excellent financial shape with a
				significant cash reserve fund.</p>

				<p>Dr. Burgess worked as an adjunct professor with Converse College in Spartanburg, SC, and the
				Citadel in Charleston, SC. He has been recognized by numerous local, state, regional, and
				national organizations as an educator. Burgess was honored as the Secondary Principal of the
				Year for the State of South Carolina in 1996 and was named a Milken National Educator in
				1999-2000. Former South Carolina Governor Jim Hodges appointed him to South Carolina's
				Juvenile Parole Board and to the John De La Howe Board of Trustees.</p>
				
				<p>Dr. Burgess’ journey and educational success were propelled from a place of humble
				beginnings. Throughout his childhood and formative years, he experienced the effects of
				poverty first-hand, living in a working-class home and community. He witnessed how the
				institutional perception of one’s social-economic and ethnic status negatively impacts formal
				learning; creating and perpetuating institutionalized academic underperformance. Informed by
				his experiences, Dr. Burgess has worked tirelessly to undo these inequalities throughout South
				Carolina, the United States, and internationally. Through education, Dr. Burgess has strived for
				self-betterment. A path informed by his faith, he works to lift his fellow man. Burgess is a
				selfless leader called to leadership through education in guiding others on their path for “better.”</p>

				<p>Dr. Burgess was invited to the University of Cincinnati as a guest lecturer in 2019 to address the
				university’s music education students. He was tapped by Wofford College, his Alma Mater, to
				assist with the 2015 celebration commemorating and honoring the history Wofford has shared
				with the African American community since the school’s founding- The 1854 Campaign. In
				March 2013, he was named the court-appointed receiver for the South Carolina Public Charter
				School District, divesting the assets of the de-chartered Mary L. Dinkins Charter School and
				vesting those assets in the Lee County School District and the Sumter School District in South
				Carolina. Burgess served on the Transition Assessment Team for South Carolina’s
				Superintendent of Education in 2010. Currently, he serves on the Anderson County Board of
				Education as an elected public official. Burgess is C.E.O. and president of BRAG - the Burgess
				Research Action Group. He served as a consultant with American Educational Consultants of
				Beachwood, Ohio.</p>

				<p>In 1988, Burgess co-authored an article published by the National Association of Secondary
				School Principals titled: “College Start: A Smooth Transition for Minority Students.” His
				dissertation, Navigating the Mainstream: The Perceptions of Working-Class African American
				Males of Barriers to Academic Success in Their Local School Cultures’, addresses the
				challenges facing black male students as a group. His 2009 book with Star Books of Baltimore,
				Maryland, Distorted: Restoring the Intellectual Image of Students of American Slave Descent,
				speaks to correcting the negative psychological and social conditioning of black students.
				Burgess is often a guest columnist in various regional and statewide news publications as a
				result of his advocacy. His motto is simply stated but profound, ”all children are our children”.</p>

				Public Education: Conversations for an Enlarging Public Square, published by Teachers College
				Press. He was a guest columnist in P C Teach It, a national educational magazine. Burgess is
				highlighted in the HOPE (Harnessing Optimism and Potential through Education) Foundation’s
				video series entitled “Failure is not an Option.” He served on the board of the Wofford College
				National Alumni Association. Burgess was recognized by Wofford as the Outstanding Young
				Alumnus of the Year in 1997, the first African American to receive this distinction in the college’s
				history. In 2006, he was one of five Anderson County citizens to receive the coveted “Pointing
				the Way Award” given by the Anderson Independent-Mail newspaper. Burgess was recognized
				as a “Hometown Hero” in February 2013, in the Anderson School District Four area which he

				addressed an interdenominational faith youth group on the Lewis Islands in Stornoway,
				Scotland in May 2000. In September 2000, he was one of two principals in the nation to
				address the National Blue Ribbon Schools Ceremony held in Washington, D. C., sponsored by
				the United States Department of Education. The following year Burgess (the only principal in
				the nation), along with former First Lady Laura Bush, addressed the October 2001 National Blue
				Ribbon Schools Conference held in the nation’s capital. That same year he presented at the
				National Educational Policy Fellowship in Miami, Florida.</p>

				<p>Burgess has completed numerous seminars and conducted various workshops and school
				improvement forums. He worked with the National Dropout Prevention Center, housed at
				Clemson University, on a Program Assessment and Review Team to evaluate the Elmira City
				School District middle schools in New York in April 2002. Burgess addressed the National
				School Reform Conference held in Cleveland, Ohio in June 2002. He presented, in December

				World. In July 2003, he completed a Superintendent’s Leadership Seminar at Columbia
				University in New York City. In April 2008, Burgess conducted a forum, during a national
				institute in Reading, Massachusetts, addressing how educators might successfully engage
				students of poverty in the academic culture of their own schools. Most recently he served as a
				principal organizer of the National Moving Forward Together Summit held in Columbia, South
				Carolina in 2016 and 2017, and in 2018 and 2020 he attended the Center for the Education and

				<p>Burgess has an impressive action-oriented history regarding school reform as a reflective
				practitioner. He personally experienced the effects of poverty growing up in a working-class
				home. He witnessed how the institutional perception of one’s social-economic and ethnic status
				negatively impacts formal learning; thereby, creating and perpetuating institutionalized
				academic underperformance. Burgess understands the difference between learning and
				“schooling.” He knows learning is the most important outcome; therefore, learning should not
				be constrained by the traditional school structure, the traditional school facility, the traditional
				school day, or the traditional school year. Burgess works with organizations that are
				transforming how students learn the prescribed formal curriculum. He has influenced and
				overseen the transformation of suburban-middle-class schools, schools with rural-mill-village
				backgrounds, and urban schools. Burgess has a strong commitment to making a positive
				difference in the lives of the students and the communities he serves, whether it is in the
				classroom, the administrative office, the board room, or the House of Faith.</p>

				public-school system in Anderson, South Carolina. The Anderson County School Board elected
				him as secretary of the board, and he serves on the Budget Committee.</p>
